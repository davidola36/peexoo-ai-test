        How AI can improve Peexoo
        What is AI ?
        How can Ai be used to boost the buisness
        Frontend image compression
        Used as a customer support agent 
        To enhance reporting speed and accuracy
        To detect faces and objects im videos and images
        To streamline hiring metrics for new workers
        What are the limitations of AI for a start up
        It takes a long time to build a model
        Requires a lot of input data 
        How are you equiped to handle it
        I am well versed in both js and python 
        I can build models both for the browser, backend and as its own api
        I have knowledge of different prebuilt models that have high accuracy that can easily be prebuilt and deployed to shorten time to market. 


        Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field Minsk and McCarthy described artificial intelligence as any task performed by a program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the task.

        The rise of AI has made it possible to automate complex tasks that would have needed a professional to spend time doing, these tasks range from image classification to stock predictions. Here are some ways AI can be used to improve Peexoo as a business:

        Image Compression: Lossless compression will save time to upload for the users and money for storage space for the company.

        Image Detection - Using AI it is possible to detect different things in images from faces to different kinds of objects, this can be used to make some cool features like face finders and object locators.

        Image Manipulation: Ai can be used for image manipulation, to create different image filters and even to edit images to professional quality.

        Customer Support Agent: It is possible to use Ai to automate customer queries to the site, this will create a better customer experience and will be stressfree as it will require less or no hands to handle.

        To enhance Reporting Speed and Accuracy: Ai can be used to analyze user data on how they use the platform and buy products and also how campaigns affect user flow to the site. This information can be used to make informed decisions about what features to develop and what type of campaign to run. An added advantage to using AI is that it removes a Human prone error due to stress or oversight

        To streamline hiring metrics for HR: AI can be used to cut down the HR time to hire new employees by going through CVs and filtering out all the relevant candidates from the group. It can also take it a step further by analyzing how they answer their question to see who is more likely to stay for longer in the company 

        These are just some of the things that can be achieved with AI. But even with all its usefulness AI still has its limitations, these are:
        Requires some domain knowledge
        Takes time to build an accurate model
        It takes time to gather data to train a model
        These limitations can greatly hinder time to market and this is not acceptable for a start-up whose goal is to break things and move fast. 
        Fortunately, I have the necessary skills to overcome these limitations. I can
        Build models Javascript and Python
        Build models that run in browsers and backend API 
        Implement pre-trained models that have high accuracy in the interim while we develop our own custom solutions if need be, this will help boost the time to market of the product.
        In conclusion, using AI the right way can bring a significant boost to Peexoo as a company and I have the domain skills and product knowledge to implement these solutions efficiently and timely.
